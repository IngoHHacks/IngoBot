### Uploading Stickers
Stickers can be uploaded on [this page](https://ingoh.net/stickers/upload).  
Technically there are no restrictions on which stickers you can upload. However, in case of naming conflicts, stickers that do not follow the following guidelines may be deleted without prior notice:
- Stickers should not be larger than 320x320.
- Stickers should not contain any pictures of explicit or otherwise NSFW content. Drawings are fine. However, it is recommended to not upload such content until a sticker labeling system is added.

Currently, stickers can be uploaded by anyone, and names are first-come, first-serve. This may be changed in the future, but I would like to keep uploading stickers as easy as possible.  
It is not possible to get a list of, search for, or label stickers at this moment. However, I am working on implementing this in the future.
