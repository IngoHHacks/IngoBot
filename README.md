## IngoBot Discord Bot

### Using
To use the bot, simply add it to your server with [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=931359987526144070&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).  
The bot will automatically be updated, so you do not need to do anything after the bot is added.  
For using the bot features, refer to [DOCUMENTATION.md](https://github.com/IngoHHacks/IngoBot/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Developing
I am not currently looking for help with developing IngoBot, but I do accept feature requests and will aim to consider and start with them as soon as possible.
